## Elastic File System (EFS) - Managed File Storage for EC2

- Managed NFS (`Network File System`) that can be mounted on many EC2
- EFS works with EC2 instances `in multi AZs`. Ex:
  . EC2 in us-east-1a can connect to EFS
  . EC2 in us-east-1b can connect to EFS
  . EC2 in us-east-1c can connect to EFS

- Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use for each GB
- Only compatible with `Linux based AMI` (not Windows)
- `Encryption at rest` with KMS (Key Management Service)
- Don't need to plan the capacity, NFS will `scale automatically`
- `Use Security Group` to control access to EFS
- `Use NFSv4.1` protocol
- Use cases
  . Content management, web serving, data sharing...
