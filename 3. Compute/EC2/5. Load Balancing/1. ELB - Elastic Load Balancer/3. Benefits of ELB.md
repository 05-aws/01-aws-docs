## Benefits of Using ELB

- `High Availability`
  . `Distributes traffic` across `multiple AZs` to ensure availability

- `Scalability`
  . `Automatically scales up or down` to handle varying traffic loads.

- `Fault Tolerance`
  . `Automatically reroutes traffic` to `healthy targets` if any target becomes unhealthy

- `Security`
  . Integration with `AWS WAF`, `TLS encryption`, and `Security Groups` to control access

- `Cost-Effectiveness`
  . `Pay-as-you-go` pricing based on usage (hourly + per GB data transfer).

## Why use a load balancer?

- Spread traffic to across multiple downstream instances
- Export a single point of access (DNS)
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health checks to your instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your application
- Enforce stickiness with cookie
- Separate public traffic from private traffic
