## Key Concepts of ELB

- `Listeners`
  . Defines the `port and protocol` on which the load balancer `listens for incoming connections`

- `Target Groups`
  . Is a logical `grouping of targets` (EC2 instances, Lambda functions...) that an ELB `can route traffic to`

- `Health Checks`
  . Continuously `monitors the health of targets` (Ex: EC2 instances) and only `routes traffic to healthy targets`
  . Health check is `done on a port and a route` (/health is common path). If the response is not 200, then instance is unhealthy

- `Cross-Zone Load Balancing`
  . Ensures traffic is `distributed evenly across all registered targets` in all Availability Zones

- `Security Groups and Access Control`
  . Security groups `control incoming and outgoing traffic` for the load balancer.
  . `AWS WAF` (Web Application Firewall) can be `integrated with ALB for protection` from common web exploits like SQL injection and XSS.
