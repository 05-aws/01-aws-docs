## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

- AMI is a `pre-configured template` that contains the operating system, software, libraries, and application environment required to `launch a virtual server (EC2 instance)`
- Serves as the `blueprint for creating multiple instances` with `identical configurations`, ensuring `consistency and efficiency` in deployment

## - Components of an AMI

- `Root volume`
  . A primary storage that contains the OS, application files, and software
  . It can be an EBS volume or an instance store

- `Launch Permissions`
  . Control access to the AMI, specifying which AWS accounts or users can use it

- `Block Device Mapping`
  . Defines how storage devices (like EBS volumes) are attached to the instance at launch

## Types of AMIs

- `AWS-Provided AMIs`
  . Official, pre-built AMIs provided by AWS (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows Server)

- `Marketplace AMIs`
  . Custom AMIs sold `by third-party vendors` through AWS Marketplace

- `Community AMIs`
  . Publicly available AMIs shared `by other AWS users`

- Custom AMIs
  . `Created by users` based on their own EC2 instances

## Pros of AMI

- `Faster Deployments`
  . Launch EC2 instances with `pre-installed` software, libraries, and configurations, saving time.

- `Scalability and Consistency`
  . Create `multiple`, `identical instances` for horizontal scaling and ensure `consistency across environments` (dev, staging, prod...)

- `Customization and Reusability`
  . Create custom AMIs tailored `to specific needs`

- `Portability`
  . Can be `copied across AWS regions`, enabling multi-region deployments and disaster recovery

## Cons of AMI

- `Region-Specific`
  . By default, AMIs are `Region-specific`, must copy them manually if want to use in multi Regions

- `Maintenance Overhead`
  . Custom AMIs `require regular updates` (patching OS, software, libraries) to stay secure and compliant

- `Time-Consuming to Create`
  . `Creating and testing` custom AMIs may `require effort`, especially if the configurations are complex

## Process to create AMI

- Start an EC2 and customize it
- Stop the instance for data integrity
- Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
- Launch new instances from created AMIs
