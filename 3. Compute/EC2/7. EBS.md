## Elastic Block Store (EBS)

- An EBS volume is `a network drive` (not physical), `attached to your instances` while they run
- Allow instances to `persist data`, even after their termination
- Can be `detached from an EC2 instance` and `attached to another one` quickly
- `Multi EBS volumes` can be `attached to one EC2 instance`
- Think of EBS like a `network USB stick` that can be plug to any devices
- EBS volume is `locked to an AZ`. To move a volume across AZs, we need to `snapshot it`

## EBS Snapshot

- Make a backup of EBS volume
- Don't need to detach EBS volume but recommend to do it
- Usually for sync EBS volume across AZs

## EBS Snapshot Features

- EBS Snapshot Archive
  . Move a snapshot `to an "archive tier"` that is 75% cheaper
  . Take with `24 to 72 hours for restoring` the archive

- Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
  . Setup rules can `retain deleted snapshots` so we can recover after an accidental deletion
  . Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)

- Fash Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  . Force `full initialization` of snapshot to `have no latency` on the first use
  . Fit for the big EBS volume and need to instance out of it quickly
