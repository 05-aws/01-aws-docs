## EC2 Instance Store

- EBS volumes are `network drives` which is good but `limited performance`
- If you need `a high-performance hardware disk`, use EC2 Instance Store
- EC2 Instance Store will `lose their storage` if `they're stopped` (ephemeral)
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Use cases
  . Better I/O performance
  . Good for buffer, cache, scratch data, temporary content
