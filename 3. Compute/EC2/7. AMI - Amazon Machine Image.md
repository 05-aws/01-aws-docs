## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

- AMI is a `customization of an EC2 instance`
  . `Add your own` software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
  . `Faster boot/configuration time` because all software are pre-packed
- AMI is built for a specific region (can be copied across regions)
- Can launch EC2 instances from
  . Public AMI: AWS provided
  . Your own AMI: you make and maintain by yourself
  . An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI that's made by someone else (potentially sells)

## Process to create AMI

- Start an EC2 and customize it
- Stop the instance for data integrity
- Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
- Launch instances from other AMIs
