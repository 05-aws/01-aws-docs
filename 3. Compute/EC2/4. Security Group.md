## Security Group

- Controls `how traffic is allowed into or out` of EC2 instances
- `Only contains allow` rules
- Security Group rules can be `reference by IP` or by `security group`
- Act as a `firewall` on EC2 instances
  . Access to Ports
  . Authorized IP ranges - IPv4 or IPV6
  . Control of inbound network (from outside to the instance)
  . Control of outbound network (from the instance to outside)

## Good to know

- Can be attached to multiple instances
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Good to maintain `one separated security group` for `SSH access`
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is authorized by default

## Classic Ports

- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell): log into a Linux instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol): upload files into a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol): upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP - access unsecure websites
- 443 = HTTPS - access secured websites
- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance
