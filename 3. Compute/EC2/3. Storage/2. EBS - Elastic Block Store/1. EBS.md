## Elastic Block Store (EBS)

- It is a `block-level storage` service that can be `attached to EC2 instances` as `virtual hard drives`
- Provides high-performance, persistent, durable, and low-latency storage
- Good for `data persistence`, even after the EC2 instances is terminated
- Can be `detached from an EC2 instance` and `attached to another EC2 instance` quickly
- `Multi EBS volumes` can be `attached to one` EC2 instance
- `Only EBS volume - Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) and io2 ` can be `attached to multi` EC2 instances
- EBS volume is `locked to an AZ` (unlike EFS). To move a volume across AZs, we need to `snapshot it`
- `Root RBS volume` will be `deleted if EC2 is terminated` by default (extra volumes will not)

## Pros

- `Persistence`
  . Able to `persist data` even after the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated (inlike EC2 instance store)

- `Scalability`
  . Can be `dynamically scaled up or resized` without downtime

- `Data Backup and Recovery`
  . `EBS Snapshots` enable easy data backup and recovery, stored in S3

- `Customizable Performance`
  . Can choose `volume types (gp3, io2, st1, etc.)` based on performance and cost needs

- `Encryption`
  . Offers `encryption` for data `at rest`, `in transit`, and `during snapshots`

- `Attach and Detach`
  . Can be `attached/detached` from EC2 instances to others

- `Multi-Attach`
  . Support being `attached to multiple EC2 instances` (just a few EBS volumes like io1, io2)

## Cons

- `Regional Dependency`
  . `Limited to the same AZ` as the EC2 instance they are attached to

- `Single AZ Limitation`
  . Replicated only `within a single AZ`, unlike S3 which is cross-AZ.

- `Latency`
  . Itâ€™s `network-attached storage`, EBS has `higher latency` compared to EC2 Instance Store.

- `Data Costs`
  . `Snapshots stored in S3` incur storage costs
  . `Data transfers between regions` or across AZs have additional costs

## Use Cases

- `Web Servers and CMS`
  . Require persistent storage `for media and files`

- `Databases`
  . Relation databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Serve
  . NoSQL Databases: Cassandra and MongoDB

- `Big Data and Analytics`
  . `Data lakes` and `log processing pipelines`

- `Backup and Disaster Recovery`
  . `EBS snapshots` enable easy backup and restoration

- `Container Storage`
  . Kubernetes clusters

- `Development and Testing`
  . `Isolated environments` for development or testing purposes
