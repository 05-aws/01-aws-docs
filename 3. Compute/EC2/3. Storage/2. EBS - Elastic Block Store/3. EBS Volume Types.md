## EBS Volume Types

- `General Purpose SSD (gp2, gp3)`
  . Cost-effective storage with balanced performance
  . For most general workloads
  . Max IOPS: `16,000 IOPS`

- `Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1, io2, io2 Block Express)`
  . `High-performance` or `latency-sensitive` storage for `critical workloads` with IOPS requirements
  . Only volume types `supports Multi-Attach` (an EBS volume can be attached to multi EC2 instances)
  . Max IOPS: `64,000 IOPS` per volume for io1 and io2, `256,000 IOPS` per volume for io2 Block Express

- `Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)`
  . `Low-cost`, high-throughput storage for `heavy, sequential workloads`
  . Max IOPS: `500 IOPS`

- `Cold HDD (sc1)`
  . `Lowest-cost` storage for `infrequent access` and archival needs
