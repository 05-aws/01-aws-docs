## EBS Snapshot Features

- EBS Snapshot Archive
  . Move a snapshot `to an "archive tier"` that is 75% cheaper
  . Take with `24 to 72 hours for restoring` the archive

- Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
  . Setup rules can `retain deleted snapshots` so we can recover after an accidental deletion
  . Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)

- Fash Snapshot Restore (FSR)

  . Fit for the big EBS volume and need to instance out of it quickly
