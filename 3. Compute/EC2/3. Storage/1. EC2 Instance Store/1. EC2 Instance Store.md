## Overview

- It is a `temporary`, `high-speed storage` option `directly attached` to an EC2 instance
- It is `ephemeral` â€” meaning the data is `lost if` the instance is `stopped`, `hibernated`, or `terminated`
- It is `physically attached` to the host server, which gives it `low-latency`, `high-throughput` characteristics
- The `storage capacity` and `number of instance store` volumes available `depend on the EC2 instance type`

- Use cases
  . Better I/O performance
  . Good for buffer, cache, scratch data, temporary content

## Pros

- `High Performance`
  . Low latency, high throughput, high bandwidth => Good for `large, sequential I/O workloads`
  . `Physically attached` to the instance
  . Access is much `faster than EBS` (network-attached storage)

- `No Additional Cost`
  . Unlike EBS, which incurs an extra charge
  . Instance store volumes `are included in the cost` of the EC2 instance

- `Distributed and Scalable`
  . `Multiple volumes` can be attached to the instance
  . `Performance scales` with the instance size/type.

## Cons

- `Data is Not Persistent`
  . Data `is lost` when the instance is `stopped, hibernated, or terminated`

- `Limited Capacity`
  . Unlike EBS, you cannot take a snapshot of an instance store volume
  . Storage `capacity is fixed` and dependent on the EC2 instance type

- `No Snapshots or Backups`
  . Workaround by manual backup processes (like copying data to S3 or EBS)

- `No Encryption at Rest by Default`
  . Unlike EBS, instance store volumes are not encrypted by AWS by default

## Use Cases

- Temporary / Scratch Data Storage
  . `Big Data processing`, `data analytics`, and `ETL` jobs

- High-Performance Caching
  . Fit for `Redis` or `Memcached`

- Buffer for High-Volume Streaming Data
  . Real-time `media processing`, `video encoding`, and `data streaming` applications

- Ephemeral Distributed Systems
  . Distributed systems like `Apache Hadoop`, `Apache Spark`, or `Kubernetes nodes`

- Machine Learning / AI Workloads
  . ML training jobs with large datasets
