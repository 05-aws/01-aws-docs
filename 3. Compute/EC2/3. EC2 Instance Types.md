## EC2 Instance Types

- EC2 Instance Types follows naming convention. Ex: m5.2xlarge
  . m: instance class
  . 5: generation (AWS improves it overtime)
  . 2xlarge: size within the instance class

## General Purpose

- Great for a diversity of workloads such as a web servers or code repositories
- Balance between
  . Compute
  . Memory
  . Network
- t2.micro is a free tier for General Purpose

## Compute Optimized

- Type name start with C (Compute) mostly
- Great for compute-intensive tasks that `require high performance processors`
  . Batch processing workloads
  . Media transcoding
  . High performance web servers
  . High performance computing (HPC)
  . Scientific modeling & machine learning
  . Dedicated gaming servers

## Memory Optimized

- Type name start with R (RAM) or X mostly
- Fash performance for workloads that `process large data sets in memory`
- Use cases
  . High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  . Distributed web scale cache stores
  . In-memory databases optimized for BI (Business Intelligence)
  . Applications performing real-time processing or big unstructured data

## Storage Optimized

- Great for storage-intensive tasks that requires high, `sequential read and write access` to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases
  . High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  . Relation and NoSQL databases
  . Cache for in-memory databases (Ex: Redis...)
  . Data warehouse applications
  . Distributed file systems
