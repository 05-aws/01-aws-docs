## EFS Lifecycle Management

- `Save cost` by `moving files into` Infrequent Access (IA) or Archive storage classes
- By default, files in EFS will be
  . `Back to Standard storage` when that's first accessed in IA or Archive
  . `Back to Infrequent Access (IA)` after 30 days since last access
  . `Back to Archive` after 90 days since last access
