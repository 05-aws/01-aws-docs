## EFS Storage Classes

- Help `optimize costs` by allowing users to store files based on access patterns

## Storage Tiers

- `Standard`
  . Designed for `frequently access files` (daily or weekly)
  . Optimized for `frequent access` and `low-latency operations`

- `Infrequent access (IA)`
  . Designed for files that are accessed `less frequently`
  . Offers `lower storage costs` but `higher access fees` (pay per request)

- `Archive`
  . Rarely accessed data (few times each year), 50% cheaper
