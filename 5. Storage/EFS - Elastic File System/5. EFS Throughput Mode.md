## Throughput Mode

- `Bursting` - provides throughput that `scales with amount of storage`. Ex: you have 1 TB => you get 1 TB + a little more
- `Elastic (Recommend)` - for `unpredictable I/O workloads`, `scale automatically` and `pay for what we use`
- `Provisioned` - for `estimatable I/O workloads`, `pay for throughput provisioned`
