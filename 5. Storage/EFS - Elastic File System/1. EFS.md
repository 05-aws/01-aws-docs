## Elastic File System (EFS) - Managed File Storage for EC2

- It is a `Serverless`, `scalable, and managed file storage service`
- Allows multiple `EC2` instances, `AWS` Lambda functions, and other AWS services to `access a shared` file system concurrently
- Designed to provide `high availability`, `durability`, and `elasticity`, `automatically scaling up or down` as files are added or removed.
- EFS is `based on the NFS` (Network File System) protocol, use `Security Group` to control access to EFS
- Ideal for use cases where `multiple applications or servers` need access to a `shared storage system`

## Pros

- `Scalability`
  . `Automatically grows and shrinks` based on usage, so you only `pay for what you use`

- `Multi-AZ Availability`
  . Files are `replicated across multiple AZs`, ensuring data durability and availability

- `Concurrent Access`
  . Supports `thousands of connections from` multiple EC2 instances, containers, or Lambda functions.

- `POSIX-compliant`
  . Works like a `traditional file system`, so no need for custom application changes

- `Integration with AWS Services`
  . Works well with AWS Lambda, ECS, EKS, and on-premises servers `via AWS Direct Connect or VPN`

- `Data Encryption`
  . Supports encryption both `at rest and in transit`

- `Lifecycle Management`
  . Move `infrequently used files to a lower-cost` "Infrequent Access" (IA) storage class to reduce costs

## Cons

- `Higher Cost (vs. S3/FSx)`
  . More expensive compared to S3 and FSx for file systems in certain use cases

- `Latency`
  . Since it's a `network file system`, latency can be `higher compared to EBS`

- `Throughput Limits`
  . Performance is tied to the amount of data stored in EFS (`Bursting model`)

- `Access Restrictions`
  . Since supports access from on-premises systems `via Direct Connect`, `configuring it can be complex`

- `Limited File System Features`
  . `Lacks` certain advanced file system capabilities (like deduplication, snapshots, or file system-specific optimizations) found in `AWS FSx for Lustre` or `FSx for Windows`

## Use Cases

- `Web Serving & Content Management`
  . Use Case: `Store shared content` like images, CSS, and JS files for a web application
  . Why EFS: Allows `multiple EC2 instances` in an `Auto Scaling group` to access shared files

- `Lift-and-Shift Migrations`
  . Use Case: `Migrate legacy on-premises` NFS-based applications `to AWS`
  . Why EFS: `Supports POSIX-compliant` file system operations and works

- `Big Data Analytics & Machine Learning`
  . Use Case: `Shared storage` for analytics and ML workloads that `require concurrent access` to large datasets
  . Why EFS: `Multiple compute instances (EC2, ECS, EKS) can process` the same data in parallel.

- `Containerized Workloads`
  . Use Case: `Persistent storage` for ECS, EKS, or Docker containers
  . Why EFS: Containers can store and share `persistent data`, even `after restarts or terminations`

- `Backup & Disaster Recovery`
  . Use Case: `Store backup files` for disaster recovery
  . Why EFS: It `replicates data across multiple AZs`

- `Media Processing & Rendering`
  . Use Case: Store large media files (e.g., images, videos) for `batch processing`
  . Why EFS: Multiple instances can `concurrently process files` in parallel
