## AWS Regions

- A region is a `cluster of data centers`
- Each Region consists of `multiple (usually min 3, max 6) and isolated Availability Zones`
- Most AWS services `are region-scoped`
- Names can be
  . Europe (London): eu-west-2
  . Asia Pacific(Singapore): ap-southeast-1
  . ...

## How to choose AWS Regions?

- `Compliance with data governance and legal requirements` (Ex: Data in France have to stay in France => launch app in France)
- `Proximity to target customers`: reduced latency
- `Availability services within a Region`: your expected service may not be available in the nearest Region
- `Pricing`: pricing of services are not the same in Regions
